      <h1>THE BOOK</h1>
<h2>What happens when an international company goes out of business?</h2>
<p>
The setting of the book begins on the night that we found out that Borders would be 
going out of business and that is the night I began writing it. The first chapter has 
remained more or less untouched since July 18th. Although this leaves it lacking in what 
could have been some effective editing, I felt compelled to keep it as close to its origins 
as possible. Beginnings aren’t always perfect, but you will never be able to change them.
<p>
As I continued to write, the book took on several personas. From the very beginning I wanted 
it be a collective work, a combination of all the talents and abilities of the staff. I was 
adamant about everyone participating and contributing to the final product. However, this is 
easier dreamed up than executed. Not everyone had the same vision and motivation as I did. As 
I was told over and over again, it wasn’t that they didn’t care, it was because they were too 
busy or too tired. I was both of these things as well, but I learned that in order to devote the 
kind of time and effort I was putting into the project, one would have to really feel connected 
to it. Unfortunately, I failed at bridging this gap, and no matter how hard I tried to make it 
“ours” it slowly became more and more “mine”.
<p>
Thus, the first draft of the book contained a lot of narrative about the research I was doing 
in other Borders stores. I wrote about going to others stores in the Northeast and talking to 
as many Borders employees as I could. I spoke to people at Barnes and Noble locations and 
independent bookstores. I wanted to submerge myself in experiences with people who would be 
affected by the bankruptcy.
<p>
I soon realized, however, that the book was far far far too much about me. I wanted to get 
back to its roots, so I stripped it down to its bones again and started over. What it is today 
is very close to what it was after that second draft.
<p>
Looking back, I am pleased with the end result. Although I had imagined the contributions being 
more equal among us, I am grateful for what I did get out of them.
